Class: CS1D 
This Program will Implement the Queue interface with a class that 
is based on the LinkedDeque and DLinkedList classes and part two will 
will Implement the vector ADT by means of an extendable array used in a circular
fashion, so that insertions and deletions at the beginning and end run in constant time. 
Print the circular array before and after each insertion and deletion. 
Insertions and deletion that do not at the beginning or end will run in O(n) time.

part A using the Queue
Adding A man, a plan, a canal, Panama to the list

Adding Was it a car or a cat I saw?

Adding Sit on a potato pan, Otis

showing the front: A man, a plan, a canal, Panama

Part B using a extendable array used in a circular fashion

The capacity of the vector: 10
The size of the Vector: 0
Adding 13 to the back of the Vector
showing the array 13 
The size of the Vector: 1
Adding 113 to the front of the Vector
showing the array 113 13 
The size of the Vector: 2
Showing the Element At 1: 13
inserting 3 into element 2
showing the array 113 13 3 
Showing the Element At 2: 3
Removing the last element of the Vector
Showing the Element At 2: nothing at that element
showing the array 113 13

This program will Implement a binary search tree using an array, vector or linked list.
The program will also Perform the in-order, post-order, pre-order, breadth-first traversals.
Lastly the program will print out the binary search tree by level.

Inserting 88 into the tree
Inserting 12 into the tree
Inserting 24 into the tree
Inserting 49 into the tree
Inserting 7 into the tree
Inserting 25 into the tree
Inserting 55 into the tree
Inserting 18 into the tree
Inserting 19 into the tree
Inserting 13 into the tree
Inserting 109 into the tree
Inserting 18 into the tree
The item to be inserted is already in the tree -- duplicates are not allowed.
Inserting 44 into the tree
Inserting 1001 into the tree


The trees height is 5

performing the inorder traversal on the tree

7 12 13 18 19 24 25 44 49 55 88 109 1001 

performing the postorder Traversal  on the tree

7 13 19 18 44 25 55 49 24 12 1001 109 88 

performing the preorder Traversal  on the tree

88 12 7 24 18 13 19 49 25 44 55 109 1001 

performing the breathFirst Traversal on the tree

88 12 109 7 24 1001 18 49 13 19 25 55 44 

there are 6 leaves on the tree

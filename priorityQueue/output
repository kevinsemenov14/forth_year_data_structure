Programmer Kevin Semenov Class CS1D - Priorityqueue

This program will Test both priority queues with the following data assuming 
that the priority queue is built at noon and Doctor DoGood is the only doctor on duty.
Each patient requires 20 minutes of care.  The patient who waited the longest has the
highest priority unless there is a life threatening scenario. 
Determine the order in which the patients will be treated.  
 
Assumptions 
1. When a patient's care is interrupted, they still only get 20 minutes of care total
2. If a patient’s treatment starts at 1:00 and is not interrupted, then the next patient’s treatment will start at 1:20.
3. Waiting time is wait time before noon

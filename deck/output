Programmer KEVIN SEMENOV 
This programe will use stacks, queue , deques and the stl stack showing the inputs and out puts
of the data and then it will show how it takes data out of the contoiners. 
PART A.
INSTRUCTIONS - Implement and print the stacks using the STL 
<stack> with the above data.
- Tasha
- JoAnn
- Lucy
- Mark
- Cathy
- Jane
stack of doubles 
- 48.4
- 887.55
- 88.88
- 123.123
- 8.445
- 983.3
- 1.2
- 354.8

PART B.
INSTRUCTIONS - Delete Cathy and 1.2 from the above stacks 
(you will need to delete others) using the STL <stack> and print
the remaining elements in the stacks.
Popping the stack
remaining stack
Mark is left on top
popping the double stack till popped 1.2
983.3 is left on the top of the stack

linked list using the above data.  Do not use the STL.

I.	Implement the Parentheses Algorithm without using the STL).  
Test your algorithm with the following mathematical statements. 
 
(2x - 4) (12x + 6) is a true statement
{2x + 5} (6x+4)} is a untrue statement 
[(5x - 5) - 4x[6x + 2]] is a true statement
{{8x+5) - 5x[9x+3]}) is a untrue statement 
{(8x+5) - 6x[9x+3]] is a untrue statement 
(2x - 4) (12x + 6} is a untrue statement 
(((6x+6) - x[9x+3]))) is a untrue statement

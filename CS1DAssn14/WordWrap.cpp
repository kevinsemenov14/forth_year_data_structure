 * FUNCTION WordWrap
 * ______________________________________________________________________
 * This will read in a string and a margin to fit that string into. It
 * will parse through the string and create a version of it with new
 * line characters before words that don't fit in the margins. This new
 * string is returned to be output.
 * ______________________________________________________________________
 * PRE-CONDITIONS -
 * 	toWrap     : The string you want to be word wrapped.
 * 	lineLength : The width of the line you want the string to conform to.
 *
 * POST-CONDITIONS -
 * 	wrapped    : A version of the input string which has been word wrapped
 * 	             with new line characters.
